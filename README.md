# Why Measure Fear and Greed?

The crypto market behaviour is very **emotional**. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in **FOMO** (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. There are two simple assumptions:

- **Extreme fear** can be a sign that investors are *too worried*. That could be a *buying opportunity*.
- When Investors are getting **too greedy**, that means the market is due for *a correction*.
Therefore, the assessment of the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed".
